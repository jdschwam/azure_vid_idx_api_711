### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

1. **get_access_token()**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1), as it makes a single HTTP GET request, which is a constant-time operation.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory for the request and response handling.

2. **upload_video()**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the size of the video file being uploaded.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n), as the video file is loaded into memory for the upload process.

3. **get_video_insights()**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1), as it makes a single HTTP GET request, which is a constant-time operation.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory for the request and response handling.

4. **Overall Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n), dominated by the video upload operation.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the memory required for the video file during upload.

# Code Explanation:
# This Python script interacts with the Azure Video Indexer REST API to perform three main tasks:
# 1. Fetch an access token for authentication.
# 2. Upload a video file to the Azure Video Indexer.
# 3. Retrieve insights for the uploaded video.
# The script includes error handling, test cases, and mock data for testing purposes.

# Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the Azure Cognitive Search REST API to create an image index. This involves creating a data source, an index, an indexer, and optionally a skillset for image processing. Below is a concise example in Python using the requests library:

Example 1: Create an Index for Images
Python
Copy code
import requests
import json

# Azure Search service details
service_name = "your-search-service-name"
api_version = "2021-04-30-Preview"
api_key = "your-api-key"

# Endpoint URL
endpoint = f"https://{service_name}.search.windows.net/indexes?api-version={api_version}"

# Define the index schema
index_schema = {
    "name": "image-index",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": True, "filterable": True},
        {"name": "imageUrl", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": False},
        {"name": "tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": True},
        {"name": "description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": True}
    ]
}

# Create the index
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "api-key": api_key
}
response = requests.put(endpoint, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(index_schema))

print(response.status_code, response.json())

Example 2: Create a Data Source for Blob Storage
Python
Copy code
data_source_endpoint = f"https://{service_name}.search.windows.net/datasources?api-version={api_version}"

data_source = {
    "name": "image-blob-datasource",
    "type": "azureblob",
    "credentials": {"connectionString": "your-blob-storage-connection-string"},
    "container": {"name": "your-container-name"}
}

response = requests.put(data_source_endpoint, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data_source))
print(response.status_code, response.json())

Example 3: Create an Indexer to Populate the Index
Python
Copy code
indexer_endpoint = f"https://{service_name}.search.windows.net/indexers?api-version={api_version}"

indexer = {
    "name": "image-indexer",
    "dataSourceName": "image-blob-datasource",
    "targetIndexName": "image-index",
    "fieldMappings": [
        {"sourceFieldName": "metadata_storage_path", "targetFieldName": "imageUrl"}
    ]
}

response = requests.put(indexer_endpoint, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(indexer))
print(response.status_code, response.json())

Notes:
Replace placeholders like your-search-service-name, your-api-key, and your-blob-storage-connection-string with your actual Azure service details.
You can enhance this by adding a skillset for image analysis (e.g., extracting tags or descriptions using Azure Cognitive Services).
